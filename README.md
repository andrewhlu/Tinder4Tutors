# Tinder4Tutors
### A Tinder-style application to find tutors around you.

Tutors are a great way to get help outside of scheduled lectures, discussion sections, and office hours. However, finding a reliable tutor can be hard, and you may not always find the best option. 

What if we could apply Tinder's easy-to-use interface for matching partners, into an application for matching tutors to tutees?

Tinder4Tutors utilizes Firebase (specifically Realtime Database, Storage, and potentially Cloud Functions) to store user profiles of all tutors and tutees. To create an account, a user simply has to log in to their Google account, enter their location, and the subjects they want to tutor or get tutored in. When that's finished, they are presented with a Tinder-like application of potential tutors or tutees, and they simply swipe left to reject, or right to accept. If both parties swipe right, their contact information is exchanged and the request is complete!
